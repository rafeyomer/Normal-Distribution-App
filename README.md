# Normal-Distribution-App
An interactive Shiny app that lets users explore the Normal distribution by adjusting the mean, standard deviation, and sample size. The app overlays a histogram of simulated data with the theoretical density curve and dynamically shades probability regions while displaying the calculated probabilities in real time.
